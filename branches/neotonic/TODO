 + HDF needs to be able to be loaded from files
 - CGI requirements
   - handle parsing of CGI requests and placing the data into
     HDF
 - python wrapper
 + eval for CS each directive
 - CS able to be compiled into app
   + ability to dump CS into C data structures

 - Figure out how we're going to document stuff...
   - unix man pages?
   - html
   - parse data out of .h files?
