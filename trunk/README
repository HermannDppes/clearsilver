*** Clearsilver

* Clearsilver - This is our html template system and cgi kit. 

There are too many great things about clearsilver to list them all
here, but here are some of the salient points:

  * get the html out of your code
  * loops, conditionals, macros, and stuff
  * cgi kit unifies query variable and cookie handling
  * super-easy to go from static mockup to dynamic page
  * run multiple front-ends on the same application code
  * super-fast C-library
  * unifies Query variable and cookie handling
  * language neutral (C,C++,Python,Ruby,Perl,Java,C#)
  * nice iterative page debugging/development features
  * generate static-data-driven page content without using any code
  * did I mention super-fast?

Supported language information:

*** Tools

* trans.py

This is our transparent translation system. It's based on how we did
translation at Yahoo!. You leave all the english strings right in the
clearsilver templates. trans parses the html and extracts your
language strings into a translation database. You can then translate
the strings using any means. (it includes tools for dump and loading
per-language files for shipping to translators). Occasionally trans
isn't smart enough to find your language strings, in this case you can
manually extract them into static language string files and trans will
automatically pick them up. When it comes time to ship, trans
generates language-independent templates, and a set of language files
from your database.
