This directory contains an implementation of an html context scanner with no
lookahead. Its purpose is to scan an html stream and provide context
information at any point within the input stream. This is used in the
auto escaping functionality of the templating system, which would require
html context information at very specific points within the html stream. The
implementation is based on a simplified state machine of HTML4.1.

This same code is part of the Google CTemplate library, though they may have
slightly different versions.
