1) Compile  ------------------------------------------------

Simplest case:

# ./configure
# make

2) Install  ------------------------------------------------

# make install

The make install is relatively new, and just installs the
libraries/header files (and probably the perl and python modules, but
that's a guess)

3) Example 1, Apache static.cgi  ----------------------------------

"static.cgi" is a simple binary which will allow you to write static
HDF files, static ClearSilver templates, and render them. This is a
good way to get started and learn the clearsilver model and
syntax. Follow the steps below to install static.cgi into your Apache
configuration and then read the documentation while playing with
static files.

   http://www.clearsilver.net/docs/man_hdf.hdf

Add the following to your Apache configuration and copy the
Clearsilver static.cgi binary from cgi/static.cgi into your Apache
cgi-bin directory.

   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
   Action cs-handler /cgi-bin/static.cgi
   AddHandler cs-handler .cs

Since any html file is a valid CS file, I also run with:

   AddHandler cs-handler .html

* About static.cgi:

static.cgi works by assuming that whatever file it was pointed at is a
CS template. It first tries to load common.hdf in the same directory,
then it tries to load some other hdf files, and then it parses and
displays the template file.

Ie, if its pointed at foo.cs, it will load common.hdf, try to load
foo.cs.hdf, if that fails, it tries foo.hdf. If the hdf defines
CGI.StaticContent, it will assume that's the real template file (which
is how we use it on www.clearsilver.net, we just point at he .hdf files,
which define StaticContent as a wrapper.cs, which includes another file
defined in the .hdf file).

4) Example 2, imd image server ------------------------------------

"img" is a simple image server written with C and clearsilver. The imd
directory has a README on how to set up imd with Apache.

5) Example 3, using with Python -----------------------------------

The clearsilver python wrapper comes with CSPage.py. This file
contains the CSPage superclass, and this file gives some pointers on
how to use the cs handler via python. A much more thorough example
is Scott Hassan's image_server, available from

  http://www.dotfunk.com/projects/image_server
