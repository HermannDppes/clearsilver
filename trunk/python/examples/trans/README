** About trans.py

This tools allows you to (mostly) automatically extract language
strings from HTML Clearsilver templates, and from Clearsilver HDF 
files. trans inserts all unique strings into a database, and
provides you facilities for exporting and importing the strings in the
database. trans then creates a 'gen' tree where your source files
reference language strings, and dumps lang_XX.hdf files which
define those strings. 


Two mechanisms are used to find language strings:

1) Any language string present in an HDF file should be marked
   with the [lang] attribute. For example:

     Menu.Name [lang] = Start Here
 
   Trans will automatically replace this with a copy reference to
   the lang hash-keyed string in the currently imported language.

     Menu.Name : Lang.L112414

2) Parsing of html attempts to find language strings automatically.
   This allows you to leave most of your language strings in-tact
   in your primary language, making working on your application
   much easier.
 
   Some parts of HTML structure, including some tag attributes and 
   javascript, are too complicated for trans to automatically do
   the right thing. In these cases, you must manually extract
   the string into an HDF file and then reference it in your HTML.
   
   For example, in the following HTML/Clearsilver fragment,
   the heading will be automatically identified, but the submit 
   button title cannot be extracted by trans safetly.

    <html>
    <body>
    <h1> Send us your Feedback </h1>
    <form>
    <input type=text name=feedback>
    <input type=submit name="Action.Submit" 
           value="Send Feedback">
    </form>
    </body>
    </html>

   You must convert the above fragment into something like this:

    <html>
    <body>
    <h1> Send us your Feedback </h1>
    <form>
    <input type=text name=feedback>
    <input type=submit name="Action.Submit" 
           value="<?cs var:Lang.SendFeedback ?>">
    </form>
    </body>
    </html>

   The "Lang.SendFeedback" item must be declared in your static page
   HDF, and must be marked with the '[lang]' attribute.

    Lang.SendFeedback [lang] = Send Feedback
